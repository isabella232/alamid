__node.js framework for JavaScript real-time applications.__

alamid is an exciting new framework for JavaScript real-time applications that run both on the client and on the server. It manages all the bundling and communication so you can focus on your stuff: your application.

The framework has been designed to ease offline-ability and component re-use. It leverages modern web technologies like WebSockets and provides a reasonable class-system that enables you to use inheritance and scopes in an intuitive way.

Inspired by great frameworks like backbone.js, mongoose and express and motivated by the sedulous node.js-community we've been working hard to create a framework that really fits your needs. It is totally free and open source. Try it out - we're curious about your feedback!
